# Evaluation Metrics for Classification

Important metrics
- Accuracy: overall percent correct (can be misleading for imbalanced classes).
- Precision / Recall / F1: per-class measures; report macroâ€‘F1 to treat classes equally.
- Confusion Matrix: inspect common errors and class-specific mistakes.

Implementation
- Use `sklearn.metrics` for computation (accuracy_score, f1_score with `average='macro'`).
