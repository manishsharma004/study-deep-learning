# Bag-of-Words and TFâ€‘IDF

Overview
- CountVectorizer (BoW) and `TfidfVectorizer` convert tokenized text into sparse numeric features suitable for classical ML algorithms.

Practical tips
- Use `max_features` or `min_df` to control vocabulary size.
- Try unigram and unigram+bigram representations; bigrams add local context at the expense of higher dimensionality.
- Normalize features (L2) before feeding into linear models when appropriate.
